Buldak chicken - best spicy chicken ever

##########Ingredients (4 
servings)##########
2 pounds of chicken breast, cut into ¾ 
or 1 inch cubes
½ cup Korean hot pepper flakes 
(gochugaru)
2 to 3 tablespoons hot pepper paste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
3 tablespoons vegetable or corn oil
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
⅓ cup rice syrup (or corn syrup, sugar, 
honey)
6 large garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons ginger, minced
1 pound mozzarella cheese (optional), 
cut into small pieces
1 cup of sliced rice cake (optional)
1 green onion, chopped
¼ cup water

##########Directions##########
1. Combine hot pepper flakes, hot pepper 
paste, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons 
vegetable oil, ground black pepper, rice 
syrup, garlic, and ginger in a bowl. Mix 
it well into a sweet and spicy paste.
2. Add the chicken and mix well by hand.
3. Heat up a skillet with 1 tablespoon 
vegetable oil. Add the sliced rice cakes 
and fry them for a few minutes. Turn 
them over with a spatula once or twice 
until both sides are crispy and light 
golden brown.
4. Place the marinated chicken into a 
heavy pan, preferably cast iron. Use the 
water to rinse the bowl and get the last 
of the sauce into the pan. Cover and 
cook over medium high heat for 10 
minutes. If you use a normal frying pan, 
it will take 7 to 8 minutes. Be sure not 
to burn the chicken.
5. Uncover, stir and turn over the 
chicken with a wooden spoon. Add the 
rice cakes to the top of the chicken.
6. Turn down the heat very low. Cover 
and let cook another 10 minutes, until 
the chicken is fully cooked. If you’re 
using cheese, pre-heat the oven broiler.
7. When the chicken is cooked, put the 
cheese over the top. Slip it into the 
oven for a few minutes until the cheese 
is melted and bubbly.
8. Remove and sprinkle with the chopped 
green onion. Serve hot.

Enjoy!
